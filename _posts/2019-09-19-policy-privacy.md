Helmet64 Studio Ltd. Privacy Policy

Helmet64 Studio Ltd., located in Brazil, (“us” or “us”) offers this app and is the controller of your personal data.
We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information. The following policy describes how we collect, use, share and protect your information.

This policy applies to all Helmet64 Studio Ltd. games and services.

#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT ####

As you interact with our products and services, you will from time to time be required to provide us with personal information. The information you are asked to provide and the reasons why it is requested will be explained to you at the time you place the order. Providing this information to us is completely voluntary, but if you choose not to provide it, you may not be able to access some of our games or services. Here are examples of when we directly ask you to provide information:

* Account-related data you provided when creating an account, such as email, account name, and platform
* Any information you provide regarding contacting our Customer Support Services
* Information posted or commented on our forums and website
* Information provided as a result of participating in contests, competitions or answering survey questions.

We also collect a variety of information from you automatically as a result of your use of our services and through your interaction with our app. Some of this information is collected anonymously while at other times it is collected and associated with other information you have already provided. In cases where this information is linked to your account information or if the collected information can be used to track a specific person, then we consider that information as personal data. Here are examples of information that is automatically collected when you use our services:

* Device information related to how you interact with our services
* In-game behavior and progress statistics
* Related event data about how your account information is modified or updated over time.
* Advertising referral information when you sign up using one of our partner advertising campaigns.

#### HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION ####

The primary reason for collecting your information is to offer you our services and to improve and customize those services. We may also use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* To make sure our apps show you in the most useful way possible
* To assist you if you need to contact our support services.
* To communicate with you about your account and your transactions with us and our partners
* To better understand your interaction with our services
* To help keep our services safe and protect against fraud or other illegal activity
* To email you about new updates, offers, and announcements

Our legal basis for collecting and processing the personal information described above will depend on the type of information being collected and the purpose for which we collect it, but will always be one of four categories; 1) for the purpose of executing a contract with you, 2) when processing is in our legitimate interest and does not override your rights, 3) when we have your permission to do so, and 4) when we have the legal obligation.

#### HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ####

Your information is protected by technical and organizational security measures appropriate to the nature of the information being collected. Only trained Helmet64 Studio employees have access to personal information and are subject to our procedures and protocols.

#### DATA RETENTION ####

In general, data is retained while your account is active or required through obligations related to the operation of our business (accounting, fraud prevention and legal requirements).

## YOUR RIGHTS ##

#### RIGHT OF ACCESS ####
